My Name is Noah, I was born and raised in the Salt Lake valley. I've lived here my whole life and I've had wonderful experiences
I have two parents Joel and Kim who just recently celebrated their 28th anniversary.
I am the middle of 5 kids, the second being the only girl. Hunter, the eldest, Hannah second, and two younger brothers in order Joey and Dallin. 
I recently returned from serving an LDS mission in the Philippines Tacloban mission where I spoke Cebuano, Waray-waray, and Tagalog.
I've killed a pig with my bare hands (with a knife, really), twice. 
I like coding now, so there's that. 
What else do you need?
How does Nasa throw a party? They Plan-it!
I like puns
